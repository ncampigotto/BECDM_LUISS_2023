## Course overview
This course explores topics in behavioural economics, which seeks to explain how psychological factors influence human decision-making. The aim of the course is to provide you with a solid understanding of (i) why people make the choices they do and (ii) how behavioural insights can be used to inform business strategies and advance policies on health, energy, taxation and more.    

The course consists of two modules. Module 1 introduces the conceptual foundations of behavioural economics and contrasts them with traditional microeconomic theory. Topics covered in this module include prospect theory, loss aversion and other choice biases and heuristics. Module 2 covers topics such as people's ability to use new information, social preferences, and nudges. 

A detailed outline of the course is given below. Lectures will combine theory and experimental evidence.
