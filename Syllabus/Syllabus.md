## Prerequisites

Basic microeconomics and statistics


## Course overview

This course explores topics in behavioural economics, which seeks to explain how psychological factors influence human decision-making. The aim of the course is to provide you with a solid understanding of (i) why people make the choices they do and (ii) how behavioural insights can be used to inform business strategies and advance policies on health, energy, taxation, and more.    

The course consists of two modules. Module 1 introduces the conceptual foundations of behavioural economics and contrasts them with traditional microeconomic theory. Topics covered in this module include prospect theory, loss aversion and other choice biases and heuristics. Module 2 covers topics such as people's ability to use new information, social preferences, and nudges. 

A detailed outline of the course is given below. Lectures will combine theory and experimental evidence.

### Attending students

| **Objective**                                             |   **Assessment method**                       | 
|:----------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| Interpret results from research papers                    |   Five in-class quizzes; Student presentation |
| Understand and analyze experimental data                  |   Three written assignments                   |
| Demonstrate knowledge of key theories and policy findings |   Final exam                                  |

If you attend classes, then your grade will be determined as follows:
+   In-class quizzes are worth up to a total of 5 points
+   Each group assignment is worth up to 5 points
+   The group presentation is worth up to 3 points
+   The final exam is worth up to 10 points

The final course grade will be scored on a 30-point scale, with 18 being the minimum pass grade. Scores above 30 will be graded as 30 e lode (with distinction).

Please pay attention to the following rules:
1.  If you do not take an in-class quiz, you will receive zero points for that quiz.
2.  Group assignments must be submitted by the scheduled due date. If you do not hand in an assignment or hand it in late, then you will receive zero points for that assignment. No excuses will be accepted for late submissions.


### Non-attending students

If you do not attend classes, then your assessment will be based on a comprehensive written examination worth 100% of the course grade.


## Structure of the exams

The final exam for attending students will consist of one open-ended question from either Module 1 or Module 2. The comprehensive exam for non-attending students will consist of three open-ended questions from both modules. Two questions will be based on the textbook, while the third question will be based on the other required readings. All exams will be closed-book, closed-notes.


## Groups

Assignments, presentations, and in-class quizzes will be completed in groups formed at the beginning of the course. Once formed, groups will not be changed.


## In-class quizzes

During the course, you will be required to complete five in-class quizzes, each approximately 20 minutes in length. Your group will be assigned one or more research papers to read before class. The date and time of in-class quizzes will be announced during the course.

Each quiz will require you to work in groups and answer 5 multiple choice or true/false questions. There will be no penalty for wrong answers and each correct answer will be worth 0.2 points (so the maximum possible score is 1 point per quiz). Sometimes you will be asked to briefly justify your answer: answers without justification will be marked as incorrect.

Your total score for in-class quizzes will be the sum of all five scores. Decimals will be rounded to the nearest whole number.
